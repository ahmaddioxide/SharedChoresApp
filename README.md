## Getting Started

## ChoreMate
ChoreMate is a task management app designed for shared living spaces. It allows users to easily manage and track their shared responsibilities with their roommates, family, or friends.

## Features
- The user downloads and installs the app on their mobile device.
- The user signs up for an account or logs in if they already have an account.
- The user is presented with a dashboard or home screen where they can view all tasks that have been added by any user.
- The user can click on a task to view its details, such as its due date, frequency, and description, as well as see to whom it has been assigned.
- The user can mark a task as complete when it is their turn to complete the task and they have finished it.
- If a task is overdue, the user will receive a notification reminding them to complete it.
- Any user can add a task to the task list and become the task manager for that task.
- The task manager can assign the task to a specific user and set its frequency, such as daily, weekly, or monthly.
- When a new task is assigned to a user, they will receive a notification.
- The task manager can modify the task details or reassign the task if necessary.
- Users can keep track of how many times each user has completed a task, and compare it with other users' counts. This allows users who are lagging in completing a task to take responsibility for completing it.
